I recently graduated with a dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering and Machine Learning from the Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science at IIT Bombay.

I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sunita Sarawagi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Hg4HmTAAAAAJ). I am broadly interested in generative modelling and its applications. Part of my work at IIT Bombay was accepted at [ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2025/poster/29854).

Since graduation, I’m working as research assistant at Aalto University under [Prof. Vikas Garg](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JFT_m9kAAAAJ&hl=en), developing new variants of Discrete Diffusion models.

I am interested in developing practical and efficient models that can support a wide range of inference tasks, as well as in exploring robust evaluation methods to better understand their capabilities and limitations. 

You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=meuyHdkAAAAJ), and explore my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/prateekgargX).
