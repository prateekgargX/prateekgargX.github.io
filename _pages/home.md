I recently graduated with a dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering and Machine Learning from the Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science at IIT Bombay.

I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sunita Sarawagi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Hg4HmTAAAAAJ). My research lies at the intersection of robust machine learning and generative modelling, with recent work focusing on reward-guided sampling for diffusion models and diffusion models for Tabular Data in general. Part of this work was accepted at [ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2025/poster/29854).

Currently, I’m interning at Aalto University under [Prof. Vikas Garg](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JFT_m9kAAAAJ&hl=en), where I’m working on discrete diffusion models.

I'm passionate about all things diffusion — continuous, discrete, and everything in between. I’m currently looking for PhD opportunities starting Fall 2025 and I am open to research internships or assistantships in the meantime.

You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=meuyHdkAAAAJ), and explore my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/prateekgargX).
