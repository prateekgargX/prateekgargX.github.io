I am currently a final-year dual degree student (B.Tech + M.Tech in Electrical Engineering and Machine Learning) at the Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science, IIT Bombay.

I’m fortunate to be advised by Prof. Sunita Sarawagi, and my research lies at the intersection of robust machine learning and generative modelling. My current work focuses on reward-guided sampling for diffusion models and generative approaches for actionable recourse. Part of this work was recently accepted at [ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2025/poster/29854).

I’m currently looking for PhD opportunities starting Fall 2025, and I'm also open to research internships or assistantship roles in the meantime. I’m especially interested in projects related to diffusion models, discrete generative modeling, inference-time algorithms, and robust learning.

You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=meuyHdkAAAAJ), and explore my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/prateekgargX).
