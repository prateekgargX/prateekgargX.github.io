Hi, my name is Prateek, 3rd year undergard at [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) @IIT Bombay with Minor in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/).
I am fascinated by a lot of stuff, much of it is centered around Machine Learning, Computer Architecture and parallel programming (expect blog posts soon). Other than these I have also been a part of [Veloce Hyperloop](https://hyperloopiitb.github.io/) in Controls Subsystem. Head on to the [projects](projects/) page to know about the work I have done so far.

Ocassionally, I like to sketch, you can check some of those in [Gallery](Gallery/), which also have some other cool pictures I have taken as well. I also like to pretend that i have a great taste in [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/nfcydzarhf61kcjd2r2z6yreb?si=252bcb8469064e19).

Also, I am weirdly proud of this [404 page](DND/).

The template for this site is lifted from [here](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).
